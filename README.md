# Introduction
<p> The purpose of this project is to build and develop a robot with capilities so that it can support and help human in daily tasks. Originally from the movie Star War, our Robot take inluence from the Robot BB-8 and R1-D1, which are smart Robots that can interact with humans.   The project is completed at University of California, San Diego during Spring 2021   </p>

# Abstract


# Background
<p> Robots nowadays play an important role in any life aspect. They reshape the way we do tedious tasks. However, they still have limits when human still need to have physical control to the robot. Because of this, our group is determined to build an low cost and efficient robot that can recognize the most fast protocol - voice command, and run on its own to a target to do that specific task from users. Our method will use Voice Recognition, Object Detection, and Planning Motion libraries running on Raspberry Pi 4 and Adruino.</p>

# Abstract

# Introduction
Our project, the robot known as RD-1, is a self balancing robot that has the goal of assisting oureveryday retrieval needs.  The goal of the project is to have RD-1 be able to listen to commandsfrom people similar to that of google, siri, and alexa, and be able to interpret that command in orderto complete a task.   Some general tasks that the robot will be able to do is interact with a user,recognize objects, move on its own, and be aware of its overall surroundings.  With these generaltasks the robot will be able to take simple commands of retrieval, locate objects that were requestedand move to those object.  After being able to do that, the robot will expand towards being able topick up those objects, locate the person who requested it, and bring the object to them
